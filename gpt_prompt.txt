Change this app so that at the first stage, the user inputs 3 options, and clicks 'submit' to submit the options to be saved in an array. Then display "Stage 1" at the top of the screen, a card with the first option in the array appears, and the user can either 'accept' the option by swiping right, or reject an option by swiping left. If the first card is accepted, display the option at the bottom of the screen. If the option is rejected, move that option to the bottom of the option list. Repeat the process with the remaining options and the rejected options until the user accepts 2 options. Once the user has accepted two options, we move onto stage 2. Display "Stage 2" at the top of the screen, reset the accepted options list at the bottom of the page, set the array to only contain the accepted options, and a card with the first accepted options appears, and repeat process in stage 1, the difference being that the user only needs to accept one of the options instead two of the options. Once the final option is selected, display confetti with the final option, and the ability to reset the application to the first page.
